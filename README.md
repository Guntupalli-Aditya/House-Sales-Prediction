# House-Sales-Prediction
This project predicts house sales prices using Linear Regression and Random Forest models. It aims to provide accurate pricing predictions based on various house features, assisting both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

# Overview
House sales prediction is a crucial application in the real estate industry, offering valuable insights to determine fair prices and understand market trends. This project uses Linear Regression for its simplicity and interpretability, while Random Forest adds robustness with its ensemble approach for higher accuracy.

# Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language for model development and analysis.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing data distributions and prediction performance.

# Features
1) Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
2) Model Training: Building and training both Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
3) Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
4) Visualization: Graphs and charts to display actual vs. predicted prices and feature importance.

# Usage
1) Data Preparation: Load and preprocess your data using provided scripts.
2) Model Training: Train Linear Regression and Random Forest models on the dataset.
3) Prediction: Use the trained models to predict house prices for new data.
4) Performance Analysis: Visualize and compare the performance of both models to choose the most accurate predictor.
